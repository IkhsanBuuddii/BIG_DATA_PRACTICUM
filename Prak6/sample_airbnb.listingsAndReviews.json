He was very accommodating with check-in and check out times. \nOnly downside is that the apartment doesn't have wifi, so perhaps not ideal for business travellers or longer stays. "

Ben was so easy to communicate with and made sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed :-) If you stay here, it is well worth looking at Ben's suggestions for top spots in the area. We went down the road to Bourke St Bakery everyday (amazing coffee and food!!) and went to the Italian restaurant Vacanza on our last night-simply delicious! We would 100% stay again on our next visit to Sydney :-)"

I let ben know and he didn't reply. I chased 2 days later and he agreed to come and take a look - afterwards the issue was much worse and the entire floor was covered in water, the shower then also wouldn't turn off. Ben told me he would look into a plumber coming and once again failed to get in touch - I chased and said it was uninhabitable like that .. and Ben then demanded that we leave that very day with no compromise with time to find somewhere else, despite us having 4 nights left and visiting from London. \nAwful experience all around."

Within about a 1.5 mile radius (35 min walk) we could really get to any part of town of interest, and anything else uber is always convenient. The place is small and cozy, nothing more you need for your stay. The TV is a smart TV with the youtube app which (we didnt realize till after staying in our other airbnb's without it) was awesome! \n\nThe only thing is, the bed and the couch kind of sunk in. So we ended up sleeping on the ground. Which honestly isnt bad at all, and made my back feel muuuch better the next day. Honestly didnt detract from the experience at all."

Not to mention the extras that I wont bother to take next time we stay like umbrellas, shopping bags, tea bags, band aids and spare blankets. Perhaps having  a hairdryer available would have lightened my luggage! \nCheck in and check out was easy. Ben was available ,approachable and very helpful. \nThe location was perfect for exploring Sydney. A 20 min stroll down historic Oxford St to Darling Harbour. Many different buses right out the front to Centre Point, Bondi, Circular Quay  just to mention a few. Don't forget to get your Opal card from any newsagent and you can top it up with cash on line! Walking distance to the train to explore further a field.\n The studio apartment on the 7th floor has spectacular views ( the photos don't lie!) and is nestled in a friendly community with many restaurants/cafes/shops/chemists all within walking distance. We will be back for many visits I am sure...thanks again Ben!"

The fridge had half empty jars, food stains were all over the cabinet doors, and the place was dusty.\nWe had a disaster in that we accidentally left the keys in the apartment (that locks behind you!). We were unable to contact Ben for over 2 days as he had left the country without informing us - ending with us out on the street for hours, having to stay in a hostel overnight and eventually paying for a locksmith as we desperately needed our belongings. Ben was not even remotely apologetic once he finally got in contact with us. \nOnce we asked him if it was possible for him to reimburse for the locksmith and other costs, he replied aggressively with snarky and unnecessarily nasty comments about our stay - saying we had left wet towels on the floor when actually we had left one wet towel in the laundry basket that we had used to clean the water from the leaking toilet that was a great inconvenience throughout our stay and has been a complaint from another guest. Also said we raked through his personal belongings which were against his 'rules', when actually we only used a couple of towels from a drawer since he only left us one bath towel for two people for a fortnight. Ben has also attempted to charge us 100AUD regarding a small stain on the bed sheet, which is a completely ridiculous price especially considering the fee that we paid for cleaning.\nFurthermore, we asked where he would like his new keys to be left so he could get back in his apartment - to which eventually he said to 'leave them on the kitchen table'. This obviously doesn't make any sense and he only replied a few hours before our departure so we replied we would leave one of the keys in an envelope in his letterbox under his other mail. Only after we requested reimbursement days after we had left, he replied in a hostile manner that he had to pay for his own locksmith as we didn't leave him his key(?). \nOverall a dreadful experience that we wouldn't like anyone else to go through, as leaving the keys in an apartment when the door locks behind your back could essentially happen to anyone. This could have been handled far more efficiently & pleasantly if the host had actually been a decent person so BEWARE."

The wifi is fast and reliable. The only downside is the distance from the city center.

Cooked a lot and worked some from there and felt truly at home.\nEven though it's not in the city center, it is easy to get public transport there. Local amenities help a lot as well, such as market and stores. :)\nGreatly recommend."

He was very kind and also let me change room, as I thought the other room looked more comfortable. The room is of good size. It is a bit far from the city center, but there is a bus stop right down the street, like 2 min walk, and the bus only takes 10 min. I also walked a lot of the times, it took about 30-40 min, so it’s not that bad. Overall a great stay. I highly recommend his place :)"

Холодильник и мини-кухня отлично подойдут тем,кто иногда хочет что-то приготовить.\nСпальное место и в целом интерьер очень милые. Однако, фото не соответствует той квартире,которую мне дали. Квартиры между собой как близнецы, но с разным расположением окон и дверей. Нам дали не ту,что в объявлении.\nПовторюсь, это никак не испортило впечатление, так как они практически не отличаются.\nОкна выходят на соседний дом, который буквально в 2-3 метрах, поэтому шторы всегда были закрыты.\nЦена радует. Рядом находятся различные рестораны, обмены денег и небольшие магазины.\nErgun -хороший хозяин, нас нисколько не беспокоил. Если возникали вопросы, то стучали в его дверь (он живет этажом ниже) и всегда получали помощь.\nСоседи и другие шумы не беспокоили, уличного шума тоже не было.\nТак что квартиру рекомендую)\n"

The studio is 2 minutes from Taksim square and therefore close to the main restaurant area and shopping  streets in this region and 20mins from Galata tower. Taksim also has decent public transportation opportunities to go to other places in the city. Additionally, the apartment was just 5mins from the Havabüs shuttle busses to the Sabiha Gökçen Airport. The studio is small and cute and had everything that I  needed and Ergun was quick to respond and a really nice guy. The only minor comments I have would be the noise from the busy street outside and the mosque. I would also recommend Ergun to provide some extra blankets for the colder evenings in autumn/wintertime :)."

I teach in a dual-language Spanish/English school and use my spare time to quilt, cook, read, and bike.  I also love traveling, especially if it's a place I've never been.  Some of my favorite trips have taken me to Guatemala, Norway, Morocco, and Chile.\r\n\r\nWe are both from Pittsburgh, PA and recently got married there :)  We've been living in New York for just over ten years.  You can count on us for good subway advice  and the best bike route!",

The house is in a quiet street and it has all the facilities, also Ali has been always very quick replying to any questions and very easy person to deal with. I will definitely stay again there in my next trip to Istanbul."

The other guests seemed very nice though I didn't have much of a chance to get to know them.  The location is excellent, near the Shish-hane Metro stop, at one end of Istiklal, the pedestrian mall that leads to Taksim Square, full of boutiques, restaurants, buskers, and the world's most flamboyant ice-cream merchant.  Be aware, however, that the neighborhood is full of very steep hills--I brought only sneakers and my feet suffered."

Su buena disposición superó mis expectativas.\r\nEl alojamiento es muy agradable y cómodo, es evidente el esmero de Ali por garantizar el confort de los huéspedes, está equipado con todo lo necesario para llevar la vida cotidiana como en casa y se nota que hace renovaciones permanentemente para que todo esté en muy buen estado. Con una excelente ubicación, situado a dos minutos de la avenida Istiklal  esta cerca de todo; en mi caso hice buena parte de las visitas desplazándome a pie. Para ir a otros lugares de interés, la estación del metro y de tramway están igualmente muy cerca, llegar a Santa Sofía o la mezquita azul toma sólo unos 15 minutos.\r\nLas noches en el barrio Beyoglu son simplemente fantásticas, restaurantes, bares, cafés, centros comerciales, espectáculos callejeros, etc. me sentí en el corazón de Estambul.\r\nAsí mismo, Ali selecciona cuidadosamente sus huéspedes permitiendo disfrutar de una agradable compañía.\r\nSin duda Ali contribuyó a que mi primera visita a esta bella ciudad fuera inolvidable."

He even went the extra step to ask me whether I needed anything on my day of departure such as a taxi to the airport. The room is just as described and perfect for a single person travelling for a short period of time.

Как оказалось, мои волнения были напрасны: Али замечательный хозяин, подробно ответил на все мои вопросы, объяснил как добраться от аэропорта до квартиры, без проблем встретил меня в 02:00 (я прилетела поздно ночью). Моя комната оказалась маленькой, но уютной с красивым окошком, выходящим в небольшой зеленый сад. Что касается удобств, то здесь достаточно скромно, но есть все необходимое: хорошее соотношение цены и качества. Сама квартира находится в очень хорошем месте: это небольшая спокойная улица всего в 2 минутах ходьбы от улицы Истикляль, где расположено великое множество магазинов, кафе и ресторанов на любой вкус и кошелек. Рядом метро и остановки общественного транспорта. Также неподалеку находится Галатская башня, музеи, рыбный рынок, можно легко добраться до района Фатих (пешком через Галатский мост всего за 15-20 минут). Мои соседи оказались очень приветливыми, дружелюбными и позитивными ребятами, мне было легко и приятно общаться в ними, даже не смотря на мой ужаснейший английский)) Подводя итог, хочу сказать, что моя поездка удалась на все 500%, и выбор данного места сыграл немаловажную роль: здесь можно с головой окунуться в атмосферу удивительного Стамбула, забыть о том, что ты турист и просто наслаждаться этим великолепным городом. Уже задумалась о моей следующей поездке в Стамбул!\nОгромное спасибо, Али! Больше гостей и больше друзей в твоем доме :)"

While it may be cliche to say that he responds to 'everything' Ali really cares about his  tenants/clients and responds to everything in a very timely and immediate fashion. Ali is always happy to help with anything. The location I stayed at was really cleanly kept, rules were fair and clear, and the price point is unbeatable for the location!  I strongly, strongly recommend Ali!"

    "host_about": "Olá,\r\n\r\nEstou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMinha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!\r\n\r\nMeus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). \r\n\r\nTopei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!\r\n\r\nFiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.\r\n\r\nMeu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! \r\n\r\nObrigado pela atenção!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHi!\r\n\r\nI've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!\r\n\r\nMy experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!\r\n\r\nMy friends and family noticed how well my \"business\" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).\r\n\r\nI accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!\r\n\r\nI took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\nFabio\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nComments from my guests:\r\n\r\n“This apartment is in the most amazing location. Leblon is beautiful, safe, and packed with fabulous restaurants. The apartment is just by the ocean - couldn't really be better. Communicating with Fabio was super-easy. He was really responsive and helpful. We are missing it already!” - Ed Pilkington (UK)\r\n“Fabio goes far and beyond the average host, my trip was a day earlier than I booked and I would have been stuck with no place to stay but Fabio personally went out of his way to get the place ready for me, great guy and will always go to him first when traveling to Rio. Thank again Fabio abs!!” - Darren Sanford (USA)\r\n“O apartamento é lindo como nas fotos e a localização é perfeita! O Fábio é super atencioso e respondeu super rápido nossas dúvidas. Recomendo muito!” - Bruna Ferrary Deniz (Brasil)\r\n“The apartment was better than we could have imagined. The photos don't do it justice. The place is huge, in a great location. Fabio was a very accommodating host. I would definitely stay there again.” - Jordan Giordano (USA)\r\n“Our stay at Fabio’s place was fantastic! The apartment is simply beautiful and it made us feel at home. Super stylish and cozy. We are very particular about the properties we stay at, and this one exceeded our expectations The apartment description was very accurate! We loved being so close to the beach and all the great restaurants around. Thank you very much!”- Pablo Perez (Canadá)\r\n“Fabio was a perfect host.  He answered promptly all our questions and is a really nice guy!”- Daniela (Brasil)\r\n “Fabio is the perfect host. Friendly and extremely helpful”.- Soren (Denmark)\r\n “It is really difficult for me to put down in words how grateful I am to Fabio! He is a wonderful host and a GREAT person!”- Justine (Dubai)\r\n“Más que anfitriones, hicimos una linda amistad. Gracias por todo... “- Leo y Aura (Colombia)\r\n“Fabio is a very friendly and considerate person and clearly takes great care of the apartment”.- Jonathan (Spain)\r\n“New to Rio? You should definitely speak to these guys.”- Vitaly (Russia)\r\n “Fabio is an amazing host with a deep concern for his guests' comfort. We feel that we now have a good friend in Rio!”- Ali (Canada)\r\n",

But things is not going well as you think!! I asked over 20 hosts from the morning, but the only one host gave me a certain answer i can stay in safe! \nYes, that was the Vintage style of dormitory shared room for girl. As you see the room has a fantastic vintage colour in it and the bed was so cleaned and the fan and air-condition worked very well in humid HongKong summer weather! \nThe host steve, he is a very kind and gentle for the guest! \nThe toilet is a very small and tiny space, but you should experience how HongKong people use their space well. I was so impressed for that too :)\n\nAlso with a very happy price, you will have sweet dream indeed!!!\n\nThe house is really close to the PrinceEdward station by walk 10 minutes and there is a public football court as well. Safe place and 7 eleven convenience store is just around corner! \n\nI really recommend a guest house when you guys to travel. This is what I experienced in HongKong :)"

She didn't speak English well, but that was not a big deal at first. I woke up the next day to our door knocking so I opened it and it's a dude, apparently the boyfriend of the other guest. He walked in with food and the two were eating on the bed and talking. After their meal, they started cuddling. Initially I didn't really care, but as I needed to get ready, clean up and check out, things were getting a little annoying and uncomfortable. As mentioned above, the bathroom is really REALLY tiny; you can't take a shower and get dressed in there because there's absolutely no space for that. I somehow managed to take shower and get dressed in and outside of the 0.5 bathroom with extreme discomfort and difficulty. It's 15 minutes before my check-out time so I tell the other guest that I'll be back to grab something to eat and drink real quick and that I'll be back in 10 minutes. She says \"okay see you.\" I come back after 10 minutes and they are having sex. It's just really rude that she was using this \"FEMALE DORM\" as her private hotel room. \r\n\r\nAlthough Steve was very very helpful and understanding, I think there's still room for improvement in managing the space more efficiently and considerably."

Host is very good with communication, answering several texts and calls throughout the week and right when I arrived. Directions he provides are streamlined and accurate. \r\nAmenities such as kitchen appliances, drawers, makeshift hangers, extra sheets, etc. are included and stored/located economically within the small space.   \r\nLocated a block off main road and several blocks from markets or mtr so nightly noise is kept to a minimum. I was there for 5 nights and had no trouble with neighbors, they were nice and respectful. \r\nCouldn't recommend sparrow room enough for your stay in Hong Kong. \r\n\r\n"

      "comments": "This a neat place, which definitely falls into the \"not for everyone\" category.\nPluses: the apartment itself is clean. It's not *that* small, certainly not by Hong Kong standards. It's got nice colors and a certain charm. And the apartment is very well thought out; lots of things you'd need (laundry line, hot pot, etc) and very little that you don't need. And the Sham Shui Po area is hopping. It's got a very \"old Hong Kong\" feel. HK as a whole has gotten rich, and kinda soft; this feels like the old HK where people are still really hustling to improve their lives. \nMinuses:\nFirst, the bed/mattress was super hard. OMG it was hard. I've slept on carpeted floors that were softer. A new mattress will make this place much better. Second, while the apartment itself is very clean, the building is dirty. \nFinally, I'd say the Sham Shui Po area is also not for everyone. I really liked staying there, but I'm a city guy and I know how to take care of myself. HK as a whole is super safe, and can feel kind of sanitized at times. This neighborhood still has an edge to it - which I liked, but again, not for everyone. "

The neighborhood has a lot of character. It's definitely one of the poorer parts of the city, but still very safe. I enjoyed living here. As far as the downsides, the apartment is very small and a little dark, it's a walk-up (good exercise!), the building is very old (and it shows) but the room is nice. The wifi signal is good (however sometimes in the evening it was very very slow). Check in is very easy and Steve was easy to reach by text.  Overall a good experience for a budget traveler."

However, the building was old traditional one so there are cockroaches in hotel so don't reccommend to those who hate them. Actually, when I arrived at the hotel, I had felt so scary but after one month, I didn't feel so. In last, the host was helpful and gave me quick response and helping. If you would like to stay house with cheap price, reccommend his hotel."

Steve is an outstanding host, easy-going but also responsible. The apartment is not small by HK standard, it's a normal size studio for one person. Can be okay for two people for a short stay. It has everything you need, most importantly a good washing machine and dehumidifier - two things essential for Hong Kong! I've experienced no problems with electricity or water heater, Aircon also works as should. Some things like toilet and crane were recently repaired and are pleasure to use.\nThe area (SSP) is amazing. It's the area where working class people and migrants settle, thus it is cheap, resourceful and any conversation on the street brings you genuine knowledge of HK culture. A true immersion if you wanted that kind of experience. Check-in and checkout were extremely straightforward and fast. \nAmong minuses, the shower room is small. It was okay for me though. Dehumidifier helped a lot if apartment get humid. \nI totally recommend the host and the place."

The Furniture, (bed and Sofa) are extremely comfortable and give a warm feel to the loft! Esmond also has a beautiful Piano, That Brings  an awesome Creative vibe to his place. The Neighborhood is very peaceful and Serene and well kept. The Block almost feels like a suburb in the middle of the city. Getting anywhere in Manhattan from Esmond's place is quite Simple. There Are many Nice Restaurants In the Area, My Favorite would be a well known 24 hour spot, called \"Cafeteria\" less than 5 minutes Away. There's  also a Pharmacy and Grocery Store a block away from the Apartment! It's the Perfect place to Stay! I definitely would Stay there again!\r\n"

It has everything you need for a stay in the city and is the perfect size for a couple.

We found the location of the apartment very convenient - about 7 minutes walk to the 4,5,6 metro and same again to the L to get over to Brooklyn or to the west side. Your dining recommendations were fantastic - Eataly and Gramercy Tavern were particular highlights. Thank you again!"

Appena entri trovi la cucina,ben attrezzata e con lavastoviglie. Proseguendo c'è il salottino con un pianoforte Yamaha mezza coda,televisore grande e due divanetti. Salendo al piano superiore c'è un grosso specchio utilissimo ,il bagno ben attrezzato( shampoo e balsamo,fon,asciugamani ), una piccola zona studio divisa dalla camera da letto con una libreria. Il letto è molto comodo. Difetti? Credo che in estate si muoia di caldo in camera da letto ed in bagno. C'è l'aria condizionata in casa ma non raffredda la camera da letto quindi tutto il piano superiore. L'unico modo è accendere il ventilatore che fa molto rumore e smuove solo l'aria calda. Per quanto riguarda la pulizia la casa speravo meglio."

I had a lot of questions before staying here as it was the first airbnb I've done and Esmond was patient and very easygoing. The only negative feedback I will have to say is it did get quite hot in the bedroom loft. We were staying over the thick of summer and most nights the a/c didn't reach the loft so we had a few sleepless nights. Also it is on the ground floor so we had some privacy concerns but all in all we loved the apartment and felt safe in the area. Easy to get anywhere in NYC from here! Thanks Esmond, I'd definitely stay here again!"

The place is in a lovely and quiet neighborhood with short walking distance to plenty of subway lines; nearly all of the major sights in Manhattan can be accessed by a single subway line if you plan properly. The place looks exactly as it shows in the photos as well. The bed was comfortable and living in a time zone 12 hours away, my jet lag was gone right away. My highest recommendation."

I stayed in a number of Airbnbs for almost two months spanning Chelsea, East Village, Hell's Kitchen and this place, and it was definitely my favorite unit. \n\nHad no issues with the check in/check out, everything is pretty much straightforward, just the way I like it.

Amazingly quiet street, walkable to the 6 and close to grocery stores etc.  Fully equipped kitchen which I loved.  We had a little plumbing issue at the beginning but Esmond took care of it within a couple of days.  Only bit of caution--even once the super turned the heat off during my second week, the bedroom upstairs was very toasty--even with the downstairs AC on!"

The apartment is a good space for a couple, even with the grand piano it was spacious enough (especially as we had 4 suitcases!). During our stay there was a bit of a heat wave in New York and being a ground floor unit with a big beautiful window with just a sheer curtain, which let in so much light also made it very warm even with the air conditioning - this might have been a building issue as we found the hallway of the building to be extremely humid during the hotter days. In saying that it would be really cozy in the cooler months. The area was one we'd not explored previously - more on the quiet side (if that's even possible in New York) but very close to the Flatiron, Union Square and also East Village which are more lively. I'd highly recommend the burgers at Ampersand Bar which is walking distance from the apartment."

      "comments": "Esmond's place was incredibly beautiful. From the large windows to the grand piano, he delivered a wonderful apartment in the Gramercy Park neighborhood. The apartment was indeed wonderful with just a tiny dust and heating issue. My roommate has severe asthma and non severe sleep apnea. On our first night she didn't sleep. She couldn't breath as it was roughly 80-85 degrees upstairs. She ended up sitting in the kitchen all night as that was the least problematic place, for her, in the unit. After a couple nights of not sleeping for my roommate, we decided to purchase an air mattress so she could sleep downstairs and breath comfortably. When placing the air mattress we had to move the coffee table over an inch which revealed a massive amount of dust everywhere. It was probably one of the worst dust situations I had ever seen. This was especially surprising since I was just informed of the recent cleaning. However, all it took was a few boxes of wipes, which I purchased, and a broken vacuum, that we found in the home, to fix the issue. Unfortunately and unbeknownst to me, I had a roommate who was unaware of the contract I had signed with Esmond and  slipped on a few of Esmond's rules : such as having house guests one night and placing materials on the piano.  When Esmond brought it to my attention, he dealt with it effectively and with kindness. Along with the rules mentioned above, he also said that the air-mattress was not permitted, although I couldn't find that rule on the Airbnb website nor the sheet he left me.  That was cleaned up between Esmond and I and we were back on the road to a good stay. Until I experienced a small amount of despair when the building  informed me that, per Esmond's contract with the condominium, Airbnb's are not ever permitted in the building. I went to look for the sheet Esmond had left me, upon arrival, and it did state for me to tell anyone, if asked, that Esmond is my cousin. I would've rather Esmond messaged that to me prior to the stay, or listed it on the site, as it possibly would have changed my mind when deciding to stay at an Airbnb where I would have to, for lack of a better word, lie to someone. With that said, I apologized for his inconvenience as I, in retrospect, ideally should've communicated with my roommate the specific details and inquires set forth by Esmond prior to our stay. None the less, I am pleased with the stay I had with Esmond and the issues we experienced throughout the stay were simply a small line of communication errors. "

The apartment is a stylish space that was well equipped. However, the other reviews were unfortunately accurate in that the loft area became unbearably hot. Since the apartment is facing the street and is on the first level, I could only keep the windows open when I was close by. Also be cautioned that AirBnbs are not allowed in Esmond's place, which became uncomfortable a few times since I had a longer stay (two weeks). \n\nI would consider staying here again since it's close to my work and provided a better solution were worked out to deal with the heat upstairs."

We were able to go shopping at the market and then cook rather than eating out for every meal.   Everything was clean and bright and colorful, and we had no problems finding the apartment or getting around the city- it's just two blocks from the metro station.   Catherine was very helpful and we really enjoyed our stay, it made me want to move to Montreal!"

I really enjoyed my stay and felt like I had plenty of space. The apartment was equipped will all the essential needs for a week long stay. Before I arrived, she had a family of 4 staying for an extend period of time. There was a little hiccup with the cleaning person getting around to the apartment before my stay. Nevertheless, Catherine apologized and rectified the situation by having them coming as soon as possible and refunding me for 2 nights. It was an understandable situation with the last guests staying so long and leaving the day I am arriving. I definitely would stay again and love the decor! The neighborhood is a great location by the Jean Talon Market and Metro station within steps.  "

Couleurs vives et décorations \"Frida Kahlo\" :). Literie super confortable ! L'emplacement est GÉ-NI-AL  : à deux pas du marché Jean Talon, à 5 min à peine à pied de la station de métro Jean Talon, où il y a un supermarché Métro. Supermarché Provigo à 15 à pied environ. Rue calme et pas trop passagère, bien qu'à côtés de toutes les nécessités. Je recommande vivement !"

The pictures don't do justice to the size of the place. We loved the neighborhood, there is a great big market right next to her place and also lot's of amazing restaurants. It's a privileged area I believe, because it's far enough from the center for things to be cheaper but you still have lots of options to eat. The location is just a little far from the tourist attractions, around 20-30 minutes by subway to each one, but her place is right next to the subway station, which is awesome!"

Our favourite thing about the apartment was the nice big kitchen, which was equipped with good cookware and a nice little espresso machine. There were many negative aspects about our stay. When we first arrived, there was no information about internet or other infos, so we had to search for an internet cafe to be able to get in contact with Catherine. We then had to wait quite some time before getting an answer -- an overall frustrating experience. We stayed in the flat for a month in the winter and had to go up precarious steps each day. It was our responsibility to shovel the steps and remove the ice, but no shovel was provided. Another major issue was the broken window in the bedroom. It was covered with plastic, which kept the heat in very well, but it didn't block any of the noise coming from the street, which was a problem some nights. Another thing to keep in mind is that only one set of keys was provided. This was quite inconvenient for us because we were 2 people. In general, whenever we had an issue, we were told to solve it ourselves. We managed to figure things out in the end, and the location close to the metro and nice restaurants made up for many of our frustrations. "

Tara is truely a great host, who responded to our requests quickly and helped us out with any questions we had. \r\nThe apartment was suitable for two persons and with a small kitchen, it was possible to make some meals at home, making the vacation less expensive. The appartment is a nice walk away from Central Park and not long from a subway station to take you anywhere you want to go. There is several grocery shops nearby too. We have already started planning our next trip to NYC and we will definitely hope that Tara's apartment is available. \r\n"

This contributed to make many everyday things work easy for a NYC-rookie as me - and make me feel completely safe and secure during my stay.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is homey, comfortable and unique. I love the art and brick wall. It had what I needed during my stay - nice light/bright bathroom, kitchen facility, nice big bed, closet/drawer space for my clothing, couch, AC to beat the heat, wifi and (bonus!) loudspeakers to play music.\r\n\r\nYorkville is a very charming neighborhood. East 87th Street is pleasantly quiet, however, near busy streets where you can find good restaurants and grocery stores. I loved charming Carl Schurz Park located by the East River, just two blocks away (Tara's recommendation!). \r\nI have enjoyed my stay in Tara's home very much! When I come back to New York City (I definitely will) I hope I can rent it again :)"

The place is not extremly spacious but it is convinient and is really nicely decorated. the neighbourhood is quiet and nice, there's some grocery's stores around some pasteries shops, restaurants... everything needed. The subway is close by, and so is central park ! We walked to guggenheim, to the MET and sometimes we went through central park to the city center. I highly recommend Isabella's place to visit NY for few days !"

Von Anfang an haben wir uns wohl gefühlt.\r\nBereits vor unserer Ankunft haben wir alle Informationen hinsichtlich Schlüsselabholung, Reinigung der Wäsche, Umgang in der Wohnung, etc.. elektronisch übermittelt bekommen und Isabella hat rasch und umfangreich alle unsere Fragen im Vorfeld abgeklärt. \r\nDie Wohnung ist zwar klein (1 Schlaf-/Wohnzimmer), aber sehr ruhig gelegen, da sie sich nicht in einer Durchzugsstraße befindet und außerdem in den Innenhof gerichtet ist, wo eine Aussicht auf Bäume besteht.\r\nIn der umliegenden Gegend befinden sich viele kostengünstige Lokale für alle Geschmacksrichtungen, auch Supermärkte und Drogerien sind in unmittelbarer Reichweite, was in NY sehr angenehm ist. Die nächste U-Bahn Station ist etwa 10 Gehminuten entfernt.\r\nDurch die Lage in Yorkville sind auch viele Museen leicht zu erreichen und auch der Central Park ist nur etwa 15 min zu Fuß entfernt.  "

She gave me a complete run down on her place and the neighborhood before I arrived via email.  This being my first Airbnb experience I didn't know quite what to expect, but Isabella was always prompt in responding to my various questions and requests.  Her place is accessible to public transportation and and the neighborhood is very safe.  My mom and I stayed there for an extended amount of time and felt like true locals.  I did encounter a problem returning the keys though.  The Keycafe service used for key exchange didn't recognize the fob on the keys and I was stuck there trying to figure it out while I had my mom waiting in a cab with the meter running to go to the airport.  I called the Keycafe customer service number and after 30 minutes was able to get one of the drawers unlocked so I can deposit the keys.  It was stressful start to my journey back home."

We've stayed many times in new York and we were surprised how quiet it was, and heard very little of the noise a big city makes.\n\nThe apartment got everything you need. And with the new Q train you can quickly get to midtown and the sights. Central park is close and we walked there several times. Everything you need is also just around the corner being a convenience store, restaurant, bars..\n\nWe never got to meet our lovely host but she kept in contact and made sure we had everything we needed. Key pickup and drop-off worked like a charm. Next time I am in New York I am definitely checking first if this apt is available. Great stay!"

It’s a small place suitable for couples but don’t expect to get too much cooking done as the kitchen is tiny. Perfect place for sleeping, showering and off to sightseeing as it is well connected with the metro and is located in a safe and quiet area."
